         <h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Ummer Fayaz was born in Kulgam, Jammu & Kashmir, India in 1994, and studied at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya,
            Anantnag and the National Defence Academy.[8] He faced several difficulties while in training as people in
            his
            home were not supportive of his decision to join the Indian Army. However, Fayaz was determined to join, as
            he
            used to say "I will change my Kashmir, I will make it heaven on earth again".</p>

            candle
            march in his memory was also organised at India Gate, Delhi on an evening in May 2017, which attracted
            enormous
            support and publicity.

            connection with Fayaz's abduction and murder, was among the militants killed in Operation Batagund on 25
            November 2018.</p>
